## 1. Transformers and Their Role in the Creation of Chat GPT

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP). They use self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, making them highly efficient and effective for tasks such as language translation, text generation, and more. Chat GPT, developed by OpenAI, leverages transformers to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. This has allowed chatbots to evolve significantly, mimicking human intelligence and conversation patterns more closely than ever before.

## 2. Subsets of AI and Examples

### Machine Learning (ML)

- **Mimics**: Understanding and processing human speech

## 3. Learn About the Pyforest Library

Pyforest is a Python library that aims to simplify the import of commonly used data science libraries. By using Pyforest, you can avoid repetitive import statements and streamline your code. It automatically imports libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and more when you reference them in your code.

## 4. Ensure All Data Science Libraries Are Installed

Installing the following data science libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow or pytorch (depending on your preference)

I installed them on the WSL Terminal using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow
```

## 5. Research on Data Structures and Algorithms

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science. They help in organizing data efficiently and solving problems effectively. Topics to research include:
- Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues
- Trees, graphs, hash tables
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., binary search)
